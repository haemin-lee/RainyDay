# RainyDay

Changes since y'all went to sleep

-   moved predictions -> dashboard/
-   made dashboard/index more complicated and slightly more annoying to deal with
-   added modals for sliders + bank account selection as a util to render graphs in dashboard/index
-   made split screen w/ bootstrap column utils
-   fixed a few minor mistakes in server
-   added a bunch of loaders everywhere

Things I did not do

-   Test the ML stuff
-   Test server routes
-   Graph generation

TODO

-   Graphs (obviously)
-   Make predictions.js component (pass props from dashboard to `<Prediction />` to simplify logic)
-   Connect the API to anonymous functions in dashboard/index
-   Prettify the data grid + add new row button
-   Prettify account and slider modals under dashboard/modal.js
-   Remove pull data from finastra option (since it doesn't appear that the ml supports that?)?
